Getting Started
================

In this section is a collection of examples demonstrating how to use Nexus
capabilities, mostly via the Python client, qnexus.

If you have a Nexus account, you can run the code in the
:ref:`Lab <nexus_lab>`. You can also use `qnexus` from your own
environment.

To get started, please see `our getting started guide <notebooks/basics/getting_started>`_.

For more details on the qnexus API, please see the `Nexus API Reference overview. <../nexus_api/qnexus_api.rst>`_.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``qnexus`` package is publicly available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/qnexus/>`_ and
can be installed with 

.. code-block:: bash 

    pip install qnexus


Extras:

If you are planning on running Qiskit simulations with noise models on Nexus, 
you will need to install the extra dependency with ``pip install qnexus[qiskit]``.
