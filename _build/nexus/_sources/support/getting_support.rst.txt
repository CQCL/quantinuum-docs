Obtaining Support
=================

Here are some resources you can use if you have questions about Nexus, or issues
with the service.

1. Your Nexus administrator
---------------------------

There are a number of aspects of Nexus support which your Nexus administrator
can provide for you. If your query relates to one of the areas described under
"Admin Guide", please contact your Nexus administrator directly.

2. Nexus Support
----------------

Please email nexus_support@quantinuum.com.

If you're experiencing issues, please include as much detail as possible. Error
messages, steps you have followed, or screenshots are particularly helpful.

3. Nexus Status Page
--------------------

If and when the service experiences degraded performance or outages, the Nexus
status page will be updated. If you're receiving error messages, it is a good
place to check.

You are encouraged to visit and sign up for updates, because scheduled
maintenance is announced on the status page.
