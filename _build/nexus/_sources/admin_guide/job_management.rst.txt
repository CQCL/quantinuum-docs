Managing user-submitted jobs
=============================

Organization administrators can see all the :ref:`jobs <jobs>` submitted
by the users and even retry or cancel them.

Jobs list
---------

The Jobs tab in the :doc:`management page<accessing_org_page>` shows an overview of
all the jobs submitted by the users of the organization.
You can search, filter and sort the jobs in the table.

.. note::
   The table shows the latest 500 jobs by default. Any search or filtering is applied 
   to all the jobs that exist in Nexus for the organization, but only the latest 500
   results are shown.

Re-running or canceling jobs
----------------------------

Clicking on a job's name takes you to the job details section of the corresponding
:ref:`project <projects>` page. In this page you can find links to see the
circuits submitted or the job results.

Another way of reaching the project page of a job is by
clicking on the project's name link shown in the jobs overview table.
To see this you have to scroll the table horizontally to reveal more columns.

In the jobs list of the project page is where you can act on any job either to re-run
or cancel it. This is done via the three-dots actions menu that is also revealed by
scrolling the table horizontally, by clicking on the corresponding options.

.. note::
   A job in a final state (Completed, Cancelled, Error) cannot be cancelled.

Organization administrators can also perform administrative actions on this page
as if they were the project owners, like changing the access control, or archiving
and deleting the project.
