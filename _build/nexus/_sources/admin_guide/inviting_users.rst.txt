Multiple users can be invited by entering each email separated by a space.
An optional user group can be assigned to the invited
users. Also, you can check the "Organization Admin" check-box to grant
the :doc:`administrator permission<organization_admin>` to all the users that
will be invited.

The users will receive an invitation email and should then follow the instructions
to sign-up and access Quantinuum Nexus.

If a user's temporary password has expired, you can reset it by selecting "Reset password" from the user action menu on the organization page.
