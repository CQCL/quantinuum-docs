Backends and Batching
=====================

"Backend" is the term used in Nexus to mean the provider of quantum (or
simulation/emulation) compute power.

Backends act as an interface for submitting circuits and provide a way for
quantum software to be platform independent: the compilation and execution steps
accept an instance of a backend class as an argument. That means that with
little alteration, quantum programs can be edited to run against alternative
providers, whether simulators, emulators or real quantum hardware.

Represented in Python code, a backend is an instance of a class called
``SomethingConfig`` - for example, ``QuantinuumConfig`` - and each provider
class will accept or require different parameters.  Also, one backend can
encompass multiple quantum devices. For example, the ``QuantinuumConfig``
backend accepts a ``device_name`` parameter which allows the calling code to
choose between the available hardware devices, syntax checkers and emulators.

Job Queues in Nexus
-------------------

Nexus operates a *First-In First-Out* (FIFO) queue for all compilation jobs,
in addition to execution jobs submitted to nexus-hosted emulators and simulators.

Execute jobs submitted for H-series or third-party backends are passed by Nexus
to the appropriate queue for that backend as soon as the job is submitted to Nexus.

Supported backends
------------------

The following backends are supported:

* `Aer <https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-aer/>`_ - a Nexus-hosted simulator
  running Qiskit's Aer engine (AerState and AerUnitary are also supported).

* `Braket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/>`_ - hosted on Amazon Web
  Services (AWS), Braket offers access to multiple quantum computers from IonQ,
  IQM and Rigetti. Will require you to share your :ref:`credentials
  <credentials>` into Nexus.

* `Quantinuum <https://docs.quantinuum.com/h-series/>`_ - access to H-Series
  quantum computers, simulators and emulators. When you use these options
  through Nexus, your Nexus login is automatically used to interact with
  H-Series, where necessary. Your account may have access to any or all of
  ``H1``, ``H2``, syntax checkers, simulators and emulators with advanced noise
  models.
  
  Emulators may be hosted by Nexus or by Quantinuum. In this context, "Hosted by
  Nexus" means that use will be via your Nexus quota and Nexus's internal job
  queue, whereas "Hosted by Quantinuum" means that use will be via your H-System
  Quantum Credits (HQS) and subject to the queuing explained in the H-Series
  documentation.

* `IBMQ <https://quantum.ibm.com/>`_ - access to hardware hosted by IBM on the
  IBM Quantum Platform . Will require you to share your :ref:`credentials
  <credentials>` into Nexus.

* IBMQEmulator - runs circuits on a Nexus-hosted simulator which uses the noise
  model of a specific IBM quantum device.

* `ProjectQ <https://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ - a Nexus-hosted
  simulator running the ProjectQ engine.

* `Qulacs <https://docs.qulacs.org/en/latest/>`_ - a Nexus-hosted simulator
  running the Qulacs engine.

Find out more about the backends available through Nexus from the "Backends"
link in the main menu.

For full details about backends, refer to ``pytket`` documentation section on
:ref:`backends <tket_user_guide:manual/manual_backend:running on backends>`. Nexus
uses ``pytket`` to convert circuits to run on different providers, so Nexus
backends correspond to ``pytket`` backends.

Backend Availability
---------------------

Backend availability can be checked on the backends page in the Nexus website. For Quantinuum
Systems a calender view (showing machine availability in a calender month) is available on the 
page for the specific backend. For third-party backends (Braket and IBMQ) Nexus will try and fetch
the status of the device from the provider.

Batching behavior
------------------

Quantinuum backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you expect to run multiple circuits, or several circuits in succession (such
as during a variational project), you can request that the H-series submission
queue batches your circuits together so they avoid queueing separately. Circuits
submitted to an existing batch will run immediately, provided they are submitted
within 60 seconds of the completion of the last circuit you submitted to the
batch.

You can request that Nexus attempts to batch your circuits by setting the
``attempt_batching`` flag to ``True`` when using ``QuantinuumConfig``.

Batching will only work when you have ``attempt_batching=True`` and you are:

* executing a circuit - this will initiate a batch.
* executing a list of circuits - this will initiate a batch and submit all the
  circuits to that batch.
* executing circuit(s) in the 60 second window after the completion of the most
  recent circuit in an existing batch (we try to keep Nexus fast, but please
  account for some network latency).

If your batch has expired, a new batch will be created but the first job will
have to wait in the H-series queue until it is selected.

Batching will take place up to the ``max_batch_cost`` limit that you can specify
in the ``QuantinuumConfig``. The default limit is 2000 Quantinuum Credits (HQC).

IBMQ backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you submit circuits in one :ref:`Nexus job<jobs>` then, because Nexus uses
`pytket-qiskit <https://tket.quantinuum.com/extensions/pytket-qiskit/>`_
internally, it will attempt to take advantage of IBM's `"batch" execution mode
<https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/run-jobs-batch#run-jobs-in-a-batch>`_. Your
job's circuits are first grouped according to ``n_shots`` and then the groups
are invoked on IBMQ in batches.

Other backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Automatic batching through :ref:`Nexus jobs<jobs>` is not currently supported
for other backends.

About credentials
-----------------

To use any of the backends other than H-Series, you must provide your own
:ref:`credentials <credentials>` from that service.
