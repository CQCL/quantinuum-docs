Priorities
==========

When :ref:`jobs<jobs>` are submitted to H-Series quantum computers and
emulators, they are given a **priority**. This is a number which comes either
from the user submitting the job or from a :ref:`group <groups>`, if one is
specified.

This number determines the order in which jobs are executed.

1 is the highest priority and 10 is the lowest.

You can discover your personal H-Series priority and those of your groups by
clicking your profile and navigating to "Settings" then "Organization".

Learn more about priorities in the :h_series:`H-Series Hardware User Guide
<user_guide/hardware_user_guide/workflow.html#queue>`.
