    "This can be viewed as a continuation of the [projection-based embedding tutorial](InQ_tut_wft_dft.ipynb). In this tutorial, we will once again utilize projection-based embedding for quantum chemistry calculations within the context of Density Functional Theory (DFT). However, the key distinction here is the incorporation of NEVPT2 and AC0 energy correction methods to enhance the accuracy of our ground-state energy calculation. Incorporating these methods into our workflow requires us to redefine the final InQuanto driver used for this example because our previous approach did not yield the correct energy results. To demonstrate this, we have selected ethanol (C$_2$H$_6$O) as our test case.\n",

    "To gain a better undersanding of the application of NEVPT2 and AC0 to enhance the precision of quantum computations beyond mean-field methods like Hartree-Fock or density functional theory (DFT), please consult the [NEVPT2+AC0 tutorial](InQ_tut_nevpt2_AC0.ipynb). For further insights into Projection-based embedding, please refer to [Manby et al (2012)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct300544e).\n",

    "In order to reduce hardware resource requirements in multi-configuration and multireference electronic structure calculations, the Atomic Valence Active Space (AVAS) approximation in the PySCF extension of InQuanto was used. AVAS is an automated technique for creating active orbital spaces, particularly useful for describing electronic configurations arising from specific atomic valence orbitals, like metal d orbitals in coordination complexes. The variable `aolabels` contains the atomic orbital (AO) labels for the AO active space. The variables `threshold` and `threshold_vir` specify the truncation thresholds for the AO-projector. These thresholds determine which AOs are retained within the active space for occupied and virtual orbitals, respectively, based on their values. More detailed information can be found in [Sayfutyarova et al (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07862) and in [the Fe4N2 system preparation tutorial](InQ_tut_fe4n2_1.ipynb)."
