    "In this tutorial, we will explore the use of NEVPT2 (N-electron valence state perturbation theory with second-order approximations) as a perturbation theory approach that can be used to improve the accuracy of our electronic structure calculations beyond the mean-field methods like Hartree-Fock or density functional theory (DFT) when running quantum computations. Our focus will be on the Li$_2$ system, which presents a higher level of complexity compared to the H$_2$ molecule while still maintaining a reasonable level of simplicity."

    "A novel approach that combines quantum and classical methods for strongly contracted N-electron Valence State 2nd-order Perturbation Theory (SC-NEVPT2) is implemented in InQuanto. In this method, the static correlation effects typically handled by the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction (CASCI) step are replaced by quantum computer simulations. Specifically, we use a quantum computer to measure n-particle Reduced Density Matrices (n-RDMs), and these measurements are then employed in a classical SC-NEVPT2 calculation to approximate the remaining dynamic electron correlation effects. Additionally, we explore the application of the cumulant expansion to either approximate the entire 4-RDM matrix or only its zero elements. This work not only showcases noiseless state-vector quantum simulations but also marks the first instance of a hybrid quantum-classical calculation for multi-reference perturbation theory, with the quantum component executed on a quantum computer. \n",

    "The flowchart depicted below provides a concise overview of this approach, with the \"State preparation\" step in the current implementation being handled by the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). For further details and comprehensive information about this approach, see [Krompiec & Muñoz Ramo (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05702.pdf).\n",

    "As an alternative approach, we can calculate the energy's AC0 correction using the provided density matrices. Here, one- and two-particle reduced density matrices are employed to account for electron correlation effects. The AC-CAS (Adiabatic Connection Construction and Extended Random Phase Approximation for Complete Active Space Wave Functions) is a computational method within the field of quantum chemistry employed to investigate the electronic structure and properties of molecular systems. This method combines two crucial techniques: the adiabatic connection (AC) method and the complete active space (CAS) approach, along with the extended random phase approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, we have utilized the AC0-CAS method, known as the First-Order Expansion of the AC Integrand at α = 0. Starting with α = 0 essentially means beginning with the simplest form of the system, which corresponds to the reference system with non-interacting electrons. Subsequently, electron-electron interactions are introduced perturbatively, taking into account only the first-order effects. This approach is commonly employed in quantum chemistry to make calculations more manageable while still capturing some degree of electron correlation. AC0-CAS proves particularly valuable in striking a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy in electronic structure calculations. While it may not encompass the full spectrum of electron correlation effects, it can still yield reasonably accurate results for a broad range of molecular systems. Further information on the AC0 correction can be found in [Pastorczak & Pernal (2018)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00213).\n",
