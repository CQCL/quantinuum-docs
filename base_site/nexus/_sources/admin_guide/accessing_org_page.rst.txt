Managing your organization
==========================

Organization administrators can use the organization management page to
manage an organization and perform actions like :doc:`invite users<inviting_users>`,
see the :doc:`organization's activity<viewing_activity>`,
manage :doc:`quotas<quotas>`, :doc:`jobs<job_management>` and :doc:`priorities<priority_management>`
