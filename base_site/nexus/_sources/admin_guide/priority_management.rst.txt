Viewing and managing priorities
====================================

Organization administrators can see and manage the :ref:`priority <priorities>`
of users and groups from the :doc:`management page<accessing_org_page>`. User or Group priorities
are currently only taken into account for jobs submitted to Quantinuum hardware.

User priority
-------------

The priority of a user is shown in the "Priority"
column of the Users table. To change it, click on the three-dots menu of the user
to be updated and select the "Update priority" option.

Groups tab of the same organization details page.
