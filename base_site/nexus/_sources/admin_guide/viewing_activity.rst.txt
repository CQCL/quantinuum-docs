Viewing your organization's activity
====================================

As an organization administrator you can see and monitor the activity of the users
and the resource utilization of your organization. This information is available
in the :doc:`management page<accessing_org_page>`.

The Access tab shows an overview of the CPU time consumed for compilation,
simulation and in the :ref:`Nexus Lab<nexus_lab>`,
along with the disk space consumed for storage. These relate to the
