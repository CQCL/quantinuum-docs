Priorities
==========

When :ref:`jobs<jobs>` are submitted to Quantinuum quantum computers and
emulators, they are given a **priority**. This is a number which comes either
from the user submitting the job or from a :ref:`group <groups>`, if one is
specified.

This number determines the order in which jobs are executed.

1 is the highest priority and 10 is the lowest.

You can discover your personal Quantinuum priority and those of your groups by
clicking your profile and navigating to "Settings" then "Organization".

Learn more about priorities in the :q_systems:`Quantinuum Hardware User Guide
<user_guide/hardware_user_guide/workflow.html#queue>`.
