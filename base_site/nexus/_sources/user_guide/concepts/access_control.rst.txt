Access Control and Permissions
==============================

If you have made a :ref:`project <projects>` in Nexus, you can grant other users or :ref:`teams <teams>` permission to view or change that project.
This is done by assigning the user or team a role, which is a set of permissions that they have for that project.

The roles are:

:Reader: Can view project information, jobs run as part of the project, and any resources that are part of the project (such as circuits run in jobs). Cannot edit the project.
:Contributor: All of the permissions that a reader has, and can also run jobs as part of the project, change the project's properties, and edit resources that are part of the project.
:Maintainer: All of the permissions that a contributor has, and can also delete resources that are part of the project, archive the project, and delete an archived project.
:Administrator: All of the permissions that a maintainer has, and can also change user or team permissions for the project, and add or remove users or teams from the project.

Team access is tied to the team itself, so if a user leaves a team then they will lose whatever access they had as part of that team.

If a user has access to a project as an individual and also as part of a team, then if their individual and team access have different permissions,
the most permissive role is used. For example, if a user was in a team with Reader access to a project, but they had also been granted Maintainer access,
they would have the permissions of the Maintainer role.
