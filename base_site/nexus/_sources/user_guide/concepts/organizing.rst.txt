Organizations, Groups and Teams
===============================

.. _organizations:

Organizations
-------------

Organizations are primarily used for managing :ref:`quotas<quotas>`,
:ref:`premium features<premium_feature>` and basic user access
to Nexus.

All users access the system through an organization. Your organization's
administrator(s) can :ref:`invite users<inviting_users>` to join
the organization, and when invitations are accepted, those users belong to the
inviting organization on Nexus.

Membership of an organization makes your usage of resources ultimately subject
to that organization's quotas. Allocation of quotas to users within an
organization is done by the organization's Nexus administrator(s).

If any premium features are enabled for your organization, they are made
available to you through your membership of the organization and the control of
your Nexus administrators.

.. _groups:

Groups: manage quotas
----------------------

User Groups are primarily used for sharing quotas within an organization.

A group belongs to an organization.

The organization's administrators are in control of the allocation of the
:ref:`quotas<quotas>` to users and groups. Groups are used to assign quotas and
control usage across Quantinuum Nexus. 

A user can be a member of any number of groups. For each user with group
membership, one group is designated a default group. Your usage and activity is
applied to your default group unless specified otherwise.

To submit jobs under a User Group (for example, to use a simulation/compilation/hardware 
quota that has been assigned by an admin), you must specify the group when you submit the job
via the ``user_group`` parameter.

You can see your available groups and set your default group on your "Settings"
page, under "Organization".

.. _teams:

Teams: collaborate and share data
----------------------------------

Teams are primarily used for collaborating on Nexus resources via
:ref:`projects<projects>`.

Unlike a group, a team can be composed of users from one or many organizations.

As part of Nexus's access control model, the resources in a project can be
shared with other Nexus users individually, or with a collection of Nexus users
called a team.

In the same way that a user can be given a role within a project, a team can be
given a role. Then all the team's members access the project with that role
(unless they also have an individual, more powerful user role).

Learn more about roles and about sharing resources under ":ref:`access_control`".
