User Profile Management
=======================

The User Profile page can be accessed by opening the menu on the user icon, and then clicking on "Settings". It can also be accessed directly via https://nexus.quantinuum.com/settings/profile

The User Profile contains four main pieces of information:

1. Display Name: A non-unique identifier that is visible to users in the same organization.
2. Username: A unique identifier that associates the user with resources (such as projects or circuits), but is human-readable.
3. Email Address. The email address that is associated with this account. This is not visible to other users.
4. User ID: A unique identifier that is used on the backend to associate the user with resources. This can also be used when interacting directly with the API.

The Display Name and Username fields are editable, while Email Address and User ID are not. Click "Update Profile" to save any changes that have been made.

When creating a Username, the following restrictions apply:

- Length must be between 3 and 53 characters long
- Only alphanumeric characters are allowed (0-9, a-z, and A-Z)
- Usernames must be unique (case-insensitive)
