Managing Submitted Jobs
========================

See details on Nexus Jobs :ref:`here <jobs>`.

As all jobs are contained within a project, job management is done from the top level view inside a project.

Options to retry jobs
-----------------------

There are multiple options for retrying jobs in the Nexus user interface: simply select the 'Retry' button next to the job to view the options.
Options include the ability to retry certain Job item statuses, or to fully resubmit the job. Please note that some of these options may result
in consumption of quotas or duplicated submissions, so please be careful and double check the option is appropriate for the state of your workflow.


Cancel a running job
--------------------

Jobs in the running state can be cancelled, cancelling a job attempts to stop it ASAP, but there's no guarantee that cancelling a job will stop it executing in the event that it's already started.
Cancellation works differently depending on the state of the job item:

- Job items in a final state (Error, Completed or Cancelled) cannot be cancelled
- Job items which are in a queuing state local to Nexus will be stopped from entering a running state
- Compile job items which have already started will not be interrupted
- Process job items which have already been submitted to a remote backend will be sent a cancellation request, exactly how it is handled upon reciept will vary by remote backend
